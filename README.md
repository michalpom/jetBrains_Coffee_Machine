# Repository for Coffee Machine project (JetBrains Academy - Java Path)

**The project of Coffee Machine is finished**

The final solution consists most of the exercises and correct Coffee Machine implementation.

The solution is not perfect – it doesn’t consist refactoring from Stage6 – this part was omitted because it wasn’t teaching nothing new.

The goal was to make a working project to practice programming and was achieved.
